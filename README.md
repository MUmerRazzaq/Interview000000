Excel is a spreadsheet program used for organizing, analyzing, and visualizing data. For example, you can use Excel to track monthly expenses or create sales reports.

### 2. How do you perform basic calculations in Excel?  
Use formulas like:
- **Addition**: `=A1 + A2`
- **Subtraction**: `=A1 - A2`
- **Multiplication**: `=A1 * A2`
- **Division**: `=A1 / A2`

### 3. What are basic formulas in Excel?  
- **SUM**: Adds values.
  ```excel
  =SUM(A1:A10)
  ```
- **AVERAGE**: Finds the mean.
  ```excel
  =AVERAGE(A1:A10)
  ```
- **COUNT**: Counts the number of entries.
  ```excel
  =COUNT(A1:A10)
  ```

### 4. What is a cell and a range in Excel?  
- **Cell**: A single box in the sheet (e.g., A1).
- **Range**: A group of cells (e.g., A1:A10).

### 5. How do you format data in Excel?  
Use options like bold, italics, font size, or color. For example:
- To make text bold, select the cell and press **Ctrl + B**.

### 6. What is the difference between absolute and relative cell references?  
- **Relative Reference**: Changes when copied (e.g., `A1`).
- **Absolute Reference**: Stays the same when copied (e.g., `$A$1`).

## **Intermediate Excel Questions**

### 7. What is conditional formatting?  
It highlights cells based on rules. For example, to color cells with values above 100:
1. Select the range.
2. Go to **Home > Conditional Formatting > Highlight Cell Rules > Greater Than**.

### 8. How do you sort and filter data in Excel?  
- **Sort**: Arrange data (e.g., A to Z or largest to smallest).
  - Select the range and go to **Data > Sort**.
- **Filter**: Show specific data (e.g., sales > $500).
  - Select the range and go to **Data > Filter**.

### 9. What is a drop-down list, and how do you create it?  
A drop-down list lets users choose from predefined options.
- Go to **Data > Data Validation > List** and enter values like "Yes, No."

### 10. How do you use basic lookup functions like VLOOKUP?  
**VLOOKUP** finds data in a table.
- Example: Find the price of a product with code `P123`:
  ```excel
  =VLOOKUP("P123", A2:D100, 2, FALSE)
  ```
  This looks for `P123` in the first column of the range and returns the value from the 2nd column.

### 11. What is HLOOKUP, and how is it different from VLOOKUP?  
**HLOOKUP** searches horizontally instead of vertically.
- Example: Find Januaryâ€™s sales:
  ```excel
  =HLOOKUP("January", A1:M2, 2, FALSE)
  ```

### 12. What are Pivot Tables, and how do you use them?  
Pivot Tables summarize data. For example, to see total sales by product:
1. Select the data.
2. Go to **Insert > Pivot Table**.
3. Drag "Product" to Rows and "Sales" to Values.

### 13. How do you create charts in Excel?  
Select the data and go to **Insert > Charts**. For example:
- Use a line chart to show trends over time.

### 14. What is data validation?  
It restricts user input. For example, allow only numbers between 1 and 100:
1. Go to **Data > Data Validation**.
2. Set criteria as "Whole Number" between 1 and 100.

### 15. How do you use text functions like CONCATENATE or TEXTJOIN?  
- **CONCATENATE**: Combines text.
  ```excel
  =CONCATENATE(A1, " ", B1)
  ```
- **TEXTJOIN**: Combines text with a delimiter.
  ```excel
  =TEXTJOIN(", ", TRUE, A1:A5)
  ```

## **Advanced Excel Questions**

### 16. What is INDEX-MATCH, and how does it work?  
Itâ€™s a flexible lookup function.
- Example: Find the price of a product:
  ```excel
  =INDEX(B2:B100, MATCH("P123", A2:A100, 0))
  ```
  This finds `P123` in column A and returns the corresponding value from column B.

### 17. How do you handle errors in Excel with IFERROR?  
It replaces errors with a custom message. For example:
```excel
=IFERROR(A1/B1, "Error")
```
If `B1` is zero, it shows "Error" instead of an error code.

### 18. What are Excel Macros?  
Macros automate repetitive tasks. For example, to format a report, you can record a macro and run it anytime.
- Go to **View > Macros > Record Macro**.

### 19. How do you use the OFFSET function?  
It returns a range based on a starting point.
- Example: Return a value 2 rows below `A1`:
  ```excel
  =OFFSET(A1, 2, 0)
  ```

### 20. How do you create a dynamic named range?  
Use the **OFFSET** function to create ranges that adjust as data grows.
- Example: Define a range starting at `A1` with 10 rows:
  ```excel
  =OFFSET(A1, 0, 0, 10, 1)
  ```

### 21. What is Goal Seek, and how do you use it?  
Goal Seek finds the input value needed to reach a target output.
- Example: Find the price to achieve $500 profit:
  - Go to **Data > What-If Analysis > Goal Seek**.

### 22. How do you use array formulas?  
Array formulas calculate multiple values at once.
- Example: Multiply two ranges:
  ```excel
  =SUM(A1:A5 * B1:B5)
  ```
  Press **Ctrl + Shift + Enter**.

### 23. What is Power Query?  
Power Query helps import, clean, and transform data.
- Example: Merge two tables from different files.

### 24. How do you use advanced chart types like sparklines?  
**Sparklines** are mini-charts in a cell.
- Example: Show trends in a row:
  - Go to **Insert > Sparklines**.

### 25. What is Solver, and how do you use it?  
Solver finds optimal solutions for problems. For example, minimize costs while meeting constraints.
- Go to **Data > Solver**.

### 26. What is the difference between SUMIF and COUNTIF?  
- **SUMIF**: Adds numbers based on a condition.
  ```excel
  =SUMIF(A1:A10, ">10")
  ```
- **COUNTIF**: Counts cells based on a condition.
  ```excel
  =COUNTIF(A1:A10, ">10")
  ```

### 27. How do you use advanced filtering techniques?  
Use the **Advanced Filter** option under **Data > Sort & Filter** to filter data with complex criteria.

### 28. What is a data table in Excel?  
A data table shows how changing one or two variables affects a formula.
- Example: Show how different interest rates affect loan payments.

### 29. How do you use named ranges?  
Named ranges make formulas easier to read. For example:
1. Select a range and name it "Sales" under **Formulas > Define Name**.
2. Use it in a formula:
  ```excel
  =SUM(Sales)
  ```

### 30. What is a scenario manager?  
It compares different scenarios in a model.
- Example: Show profit under best, worst, and average sales:
  - Go to **Data > What-If Analysis > Scenario Manager**.
